For this assignment we had to implement three different solutions to the Coin Change problem.
change_slow() implements a Divide and Conquer approach
change_greedy() implements a Greedy soulution
change_dp() implements a Dynamic Programming solution

To run:
copy the provided files to your directory

From within the command prompt with python2 available run:
$ python ./proj_2.py

A prompt will appear for a file name. This must be a .txt file
in the working directory with the following format:

1 int int int ...   # coins to choose from
int                 # amount to find min coins possible
1 int int int ...   # coins to choose from
int                 # amount to find min coins possible
....                # repeated above 2 lines...

You can use the provided coins.txt file.
outputs to [input filename]change.txt in working directory.
